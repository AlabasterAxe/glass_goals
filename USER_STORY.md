# User Story

A user wants to do a better job of accomplishing their tasks. They want the following things:
 
 - A constant but unobtrusive reminder of what they're actively working on
 - A system of keeping track of the things that they've decided they want to do
 - A way to see what they've been working on and what they've done
 - A way to decide what to work on next given their current context
 - A way to make sure they're focusing on the right thing and not wasting their time on rabbit holes
